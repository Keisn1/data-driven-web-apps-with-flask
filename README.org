* Templates (Jinja 2)

- Goal: Given a list of category dictionaries with an image and name, display
  them in a responsive grid
  - Solution Jinja-Template

- Model-view-controller Scheme
  - controller (view-method)
    #+begin_src python
      def index():
          test_packages = [
              'package1',
              'package2',
              'package3',
          ]
          return flask.render_template('index.html', packages=test_packages)
    #+end_src
    - index.html is the view that we want to give
    - packages in render_template is the name we refer to in our template

- used CSS stylesheet
  - block syntax
  - span, colors

* Mapping URL's to Actions or View-Methods

- Trade-off Coding Simplicity and User Simplicity
- static vs. dynamic urls
